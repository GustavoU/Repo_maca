# README
Please refer to "pcb_2_abril.pdf" file when assembly.
There are two wired jumpers marked (with red circles and lines) that connect the voltage supply net.

The latest schematic is the one named "MACA_PCB.pdf", this schematic has been made in kicad due 
to file corruption of the previous ones (made with proteus). The new pcb board is not yet finished (at 1st May) 
but contains the same circuits and components as the previous PCB.
